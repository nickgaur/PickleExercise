# PickleExercise
this exercise is just for practice purpose. I have created it using pickle module(which is used to store data in binary form). In this i have used a machine learning iris data and created a lists of list of data given and saved it into a file myfile.pkl in binary form and then picked it from that file and displayed the content onto console.
